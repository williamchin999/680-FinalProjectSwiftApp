This Project Has 2 Screens: Home and Edit Photo

The Home Screen pulls photos from the Unsplash Photo Api and then allows the user
to search for specific images and add these photos to their photo library

The Edit Photo Screen allows the user to choose any image in their photo library
and edit that photo with text or drawings
